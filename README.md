# PRODIGY_DS_01
# Task-01

# Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.



This project aims to analyze and visualize the population distribution of different countries over the years using bar charts and histograms. The dataset used contains population data for various countries over multiple years.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from `/content/task01_Dataset.csv`. It contains information about the population of different countries over several years.

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading and Preparation**:
   - The dataset is loaded using pandas and the first few rows are displayed to understand its structure.
   - A chosen country is selected for analysis.

2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Population data for the chosen country is filtered from the dataset.
   - Years and population data are extracted from the dataset.
   - Two types of visualizations are created:
     - **Bar Chart**: Illustrates the population trend of the chosen country over the years.
     - **Histogram**: Represents the distribution of population data for the chosen country.

3. **Repeat Analysis for Different Countries**:
   - The analysis and visualization process is repeated for different countries to compare their population trends and distributions.
# Implementation

The code snippet provided demonstrates the process for three different countries: Belgium, United States, and Austria. For each country, the population data is filtered and visualized using both a bar chart and a histogram. 

## Population Analysis for Different Countries

### Belgium
- The population data for Belgium is filtered from the dataset.
- The population trend over the years is visualized using a bar chart.
- The distribution of population data is represented using a histogram.

### United States
- The population data for the United States is filtered from the dataset.
- The population trend over the years is visualized using a bar chart.
- The distribution of population data is represented using a histogram.

### Austria
- The population data for Austria is filtered from the dataset.
- The population trend over the years is visualized using a bar chart.
- The distribution of population data is represented using a histogram.

## Visualizations

### Bar Chart
- Displays the population trend of the chosen country over the years.
- X-axis: Year
- Y-axis: Population
- Title: Population Trend of [Chosen Country] Over the Years

### Histogram
- Represents the distribution of population data for the chosen country.
- X-axis: Population
- Y-axis: Frequency
- Title: Distribution of Population in [Chosen Country]

By analyzing both the bar chart and histogram for each country, insights into population trends and distributions can be gained, aiding in understanding demographic patterns and changes over time.


## Visualizations

- **Bar Chart**:
  - Displays the population trend of the chosen country over the years.
  - X-axis: Year
  - Y-axis: Population
  - Title: Population Trend of [Chosen Country] Over the Years

- **Histogram**:
  - Represents the distribution of population data for the chosen country.
  - X-axis: Population
  - Y-axis: Frequency
  - Title: Distribution of Population in [Chosen Country]

## Usage

To perform population distribution analysis for different countries:
- Ensure the dataset (`task01_Dataset.csv`) is accessible.
- Run the provided code for each country of interest.
- Analyze the bar chart and histogram to understand population trends and distributions for each country.

## Dependencies

- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: Plotting library for creating visualizations.
- `numpy`: Library for numerical computations.

## Conclusion

This project offers insights into the population distribution of various countries over the years. By visualizing population trends and distributions, it facilitates understanding demographic patterns and changes over time. Further analysis can be conducted to explore correlations with socio-economic factors and implications for policymaking.
